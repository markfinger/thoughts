Status quo
----------

+ webpack
  + simple interface
    + easy startup
    - opaque and hides complexity
    - difficult to profile, debug or reason about
  + compiler hooks
    + large amount of plugin hooks
    + add/remove assets during compilation
      + allows external compilers to inject assets
      + allows transformations and extraction into differnt
      - difficult to reason about
    + mutate assets during compilation
      - difficult to reason about final outcome
    - poorly documented
      - over-reliance on pre-existing libs for code samples
  + modular, batteries-included, design
    + functions are clearly delineated
    + best of breed packages
      + no splintering from community
      - webpack core is controlled by one individual
        - slow development
        - bus factor
        - lack of community participation
        - code/doc improvements must come from core
          - poor docs
    - implicit behaviour due to coupling
      - ex: including uglify plugin automatically causes every loader to optimize
  - poor docs
    - internal docs are non-existant
      - difficult to understand codebase
      - difficult to understand interplay betweens modules
    - external docs are patchy
      - over-reliance on community contributions
  - loader configuration
    - basic
    - opaque
    - string-based query params are difficult to read and compilicate the cascade of loaders
    + query params can defined in a 'query' prop
  + code-splitting
    - opaque
    + effective
  - defaults to JS modules
    + handles most use-cases
    - requires hacky behaviour to mutate or transform assets
  - Non-standard coding conventions (tabs vs spaces)
  + async core prevents lockups in the event loop
  - slow builds
    - initial builds are slow
      - no caching
      - difficult to rebuild state from serialized data
        - heavy-use of objects and generated props/methods
    - synchronous loaders can lock up the event loop
      - upstream, difficult to fix
    + incremental builds are fast
      + maintains cache
        - mutable object
  + configuration system
    + powerful
    - opaque
      - poor docs
    - no validation ensures opaque behaviour
      - easy to make mistakes
      - ex: 'loaders' in root, rather than 'modules'
    - mutable config objects
      - successive builds in the same process will break in weird ways
      + extending the object can help to illustrate config problems
  + hot module replacement
    + works
    - slow
      + see figwheel for rapid reloads
      + probably down to compilation and source map generation
      
+ browserify
  - poor API
    - seems to be mostly oriented around the CLI interface
    - opaque
  + well-written, modular design
    + clear divisions enable decoupling
      + decoupling ensures API contract
  - heavy-dependence on third party libs
    - varying degrees of quality
    + more packages ensures that individual packages can be maintained more easily
      + more eyes ...
  + stream-based
    + async by default
