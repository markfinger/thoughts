- Compile
  - process files through babel
  - resolve deps recursively
    - process deps
  - rewrite all deps

- Cache
  - controlled by a flag
    - defaults to true
  - state dump?
  - file-based
    - [cwd]/.some_cache/[cache-key].json
  - cache-key determined by
    - transforms applied
      - name
      - version
    - file
      - abs path
      - timestamp (or maybe just compare the cache and the timestamp?)
    - library version

- Config files
  - type
    - declarative
      - can be hot-swapped
        - compiler can swap out current config and restart build
        - live validation/feedback for config
      - needs env support
        - root keys denote environments
          - eg:
            - default:
              ...
            - dev:
              ...
    - programmatic
      - can respond to environment
        - more difficult to debug
  - format
    - js
      - powerful
      - native support for regular expressions
      - can dynamically generate config
        - more complicated
      - can't be hot-swapped safely
    - json
      - more conventional and easily consumed
      - can be hot-swapped
      - no comments
    - yaml
      - well supported
      - can be hot-swapped
      - comments
        - generally a necessity for complicated builds & documentation
      - has parsing overhead
  - validation
    - should validate types
    - should raise warnings about unknown keys
      - prevents issues from typos

- Manifest files
  - easier integration into external tools
  - paths to generated files
  - errors
  - warnings

- Assets
  - types
    - js
    - json
    - css
    - files (images/fonts)
  - implement support as plugins
    - decoupled and overrideable
    - need to be able to pass config in

- Plugins
  - should implement assets
  - state/action-based interface, eg:
    - parseFile
    - resolveDependency
